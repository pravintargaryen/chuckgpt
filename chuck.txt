Programming For Everybody
This is a series of courses designed to take students from knowing nothing about programming to the point where they have the confidence to consider a career as a software developer, designer, or take further education.

The University of Michigan has a wide range of additional open online courses available at https://online.umich.edu.

The materials in these courses are available under a Creative Commons License to allow for teachers to make use of these materials in their own courses. Some of these courses are made available as part of a packaged curriculum to small Liberal Arts universities for direct adoption through Lower Cost Models for Independent Colleges Consortium (LCMC) and Rize Education.

This is the "University of Dr. Chuck". I teach a number of free/online/open courses based on free and open materials and this site is the course catalog for my free courses. Some of these courses are available on mainstream MOOC platforms and other courses are provided using my own open source MOOC platform called Tsugi

The purpose of me building and deploying my own MOOC infrastructure is to explore some of the areas of teaching and learning that I feel are missing from the mainstream MOOC platforms and efforts. I think that these platforms will eventually address the issues near and dear to my heart but not quickly enough for me.

I also like to use my own platforms to show feasibility of my ideas in hopes that mainstream MOOC platforms like Coursera and edX can learn from my experiments.

Some of these courses are official offerings of the University of Michigan (i.e. though Coursera or edX) but some of these offerings are just from me - the "University of Dr. Chuck".
